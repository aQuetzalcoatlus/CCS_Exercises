Read the complete exercise "Exercise_X_Langevin_CCS_WS2324.pdf" and help me solve all the tasks by writing Python codes to be executed in a Jupyter notebook. First start with an overview of the solution and handle each major task separately. Always wait for my confirmation before moving forward to the next task. Do a vectorized approach if possible. Only show the code which is to be executed in my local environment. Add comments which look human-written for all important lines to explain the code. For functions, the docstring should only be a single line containing an explanation of what the function does. For all scientific constants, import the values from scipy.constants. In case of loops with a large number of iterations, use the tqdm package to see the progress of the loop.
