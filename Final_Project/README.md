# Abstract

In this project, we analyze a 500 ns alanine dipeptide simulation using PCA, dPCA, and torus-based dPCA+ to study its conformational dynamics from periodic dihedral angles $(\phi, \psi)$. While conventional PCA captures ~ 79% of variance, it introduces artifacts due to angular periodicity. dPCA improves this by sine-cosine transformation, and dPCA+ further preserves toroidal topology via maximal-gap shifting, producing more physically consistent free energy landscapes.
