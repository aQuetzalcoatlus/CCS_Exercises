The approach is based on the recently proposed dihedral angle principal component analysis (dPCA), which avoids artifacts due to the mixing of internal and overall motions in Cartesian coordinates and circumvents problems associated with the circularity of angular variables. Requiring that the energy landscape reproduces the correct number, energy, and location of the system's metastable states and barriers, the dimensionality of the free energy landscape (i.e., the number of essential components) is obtained.

@article{Kitao2022,
	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionalities of high-dimensional datasets in a variety of research areas. For example, biological macromolecules, such as proteins, exhibit many degrees of freedom, allowing them to adopt intricate structures and exhibit complex functions by undergoing large conformational changes. Therefore, molecular simulations of and experiments on proteins generate a large number of structure variations in high-dimensional space. PCA and many PCA-related methods have been developed to extract key features from such structural data, and these approaches have been widely applied for over 30 years to elucidate macromolecular dynamics. This review mainly focuses on the methodological aspects of PCA and related methods and their applications for investigating protein dynamics.},

	abstract = {A 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation of penta-alanine in explicit water is performed to study the reversible folding and unfolding of the peptide. Employing a standard principal component analysis (PCA) using Cartesian coordinates, the resulting free-energy landscape is found to have a single minimum, thus suggesting a simple, relatively smooth free-energy landscape. Introducing a novel PCA based on a transformation of the peptide dihedral angles, it is found, however, that there are numerous free energy minima of comparable energy (≲ kcal/mol), which correspond to well-defined structures with characteristic hydrogen-bonding patterns. That is, the true free-energy landscape is actually quite rugged and its smooth appearance in the Cartesian PCA represents an artifact of the mixing of internal and overall motion. Well-separated minima corresponding to specific conformational structures are also found in the unfolded part of the free energy landscape, revealing that the unfolded state of penta-alanine is structured rather than random. Performing a connectivity analysis, it is shown that neighboring states are connected by low barriers of similar height and that each state typically makes transitions to three or four neighbor states. Several principal pathways for helix nucleation are identified and discussed in some detail. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@misc{stock2017,
	abstract = {A dimensionality reduction method for high-dimensional circular data is developed, which is based on a principal component analysis (PCA) of data points on a torus. Adopting a geometrical view of PCA, various distance measures on a torus are introduced and the associated problem of projecting data onto the principal subspaces is discussed. The main idea is that the (periodicity-induced) projection error can be minimized by transforming the data such that the maximal gap of the sampling is shifted to the periodic boundary. In a second step, the covariance matrix and its eigendecomposition can be computed in a standard manner. Adopting molecular dynamics simulations of two well-established biomolecular systems (Aib 9 and villin headpiece), the potential of the method to analyze the dynamics of backbone dihedral angles is demonstrated. The new approach allows for a robust and well-defined construction of metastable states and provides low-dimensional reaction coordinates that accurately describe the free energy landscape. Moreover, it offers a direct interpretation of covariances and principal components in terms of the angular variables. Apart from its application to PCA, the method of maximal gap shifting is general and can be applied to any other dimensionality reduction method for circular data.},
